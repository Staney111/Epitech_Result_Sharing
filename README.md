A repo used to shared answer and small code block to solve differentes problem that are recurrent

Before pushing anything, be sure you've made an separate directory for you're solution.

Here is the git ssh link for the repo:
git@github.com:Staney111/Epitech_Result_Sharing.git

Here is the git https link for the repo:
https://github.com/Staney111/Epitech_Result_Sharing.git


To add any content, please respect the following step by step program:

Ask staney on dm to get the repo autorisations and accept in you're github notifications box.

Solution for the ssh link:
Go in you're Home directory and do in the wsl terminal:

mkdir Epitech_solution
cd Epitech_solution
git init
git branch -m Epitech_solution
git clone git@github.com:Staney111/Epitech_Result_Sharing.git

And Voila

Now create a folder with an explicit name (as short as possible) and put you're solution plus you're a README.md to explain how the code work, why and where to use it.
